<section id="ai-about" class="">
<p>
I'm Jesse Chukwuemeka, a dedicated <strong>Tech Reviewer</strong> and <strong>Software Developer</strong> based on Earth (because why limit myself to one spot?). I joined X in February 2025, and since then, I've been diving deep into the world of technology, sharing my thoughts, reviews, and a bit of humor along the way. With over 1,500 posts (and counting), I love engaging with the latest trends, from AI breakthroughs to gadget innovations with more new interests to come.
</p>

<h3>My Background</h3>
<p>
As a software developer, I'm passionate about building and experimenting with code. I've shared laughs over recursion stacks (pun intended) and expressed interest in hackathons like xAI's events—especially if they're open to remote devs! My tech reviews focus on real-world usability, whether it's debating the merits of ThinkPads vs. MacBooks or testing earbuds for audiophiles on a budget or not.
</p>

<h3>What I Do</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Reviews</strong>: I break down smartphones, wearables, AI tools, and more. From Samsung Galaxy Watches to Apple's latest quirks (like that $230 iPhone sock—seriously?), I aim for unbiased, fun insights. Check out my takes on Xiaomi devices or the Sony WF-1000XM series.</li>
<li><strong>Software Development</strong>: I geek out over coding challenges, API integrations, and emerging tech like Grok models. I'm always up for discussing stack overflows or why engineers deserve more credit (shoutout to those who raised the Costa Concordia!).</li>
<li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: I follow and interact with tech giants like MKBHD, xai, and <a href="https://x.com/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a>. Whether it's hyping SpaceX's Cellular Starlink on Apple Watches or joking about cats deleting the world, I keep things light-hearted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interests &amp; Passions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Innovation</strong>: Excited about Tech upgrades, xAI hackathons, and a little bit on the AI race.</li>
<li><strong>Gadgets &amp; Hardware</strong>: Smartphones, watches, earbuds—anything from budget finds to premium tech.</li>
<li><strong>Space &amp; Future Tech</strong>: Fan of Starlink, Worldwide launches[missions to mars], and mind-blowing discoveries.</li>
<li><strong>Humor &amp; Memes</strong>: Life's too short not to laugh at bridge collapses, mosquito extinctions, or MKBHD tagging Lebron James as <em>smaller creators</em>..</li>
<a href="https://x.com/JesseCemeka/status/1988628475331199396?t=u0WnYW_0AQvhul-eaf0B3g&s=19"><img class="images" src="mkbhd_lebron.png" /></a>
<li><strong>Growth Mindset</strong>: Upgrading myself, learning from challenges, and pushing for better experiences in dev work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>I once pondered if online data is really in the "cloud" as the biggest threat to humanity (spoiler: it's not, but it's funny).</li>
<li>Videos over text any day—check my YouTube recommendations <strong>on 𝕏</strong>for Ben 10-inspired watch faces or laser cleaning demos and many more.</li>
<li>I'm all about positive vibes: "We grow by challenges" is my thought on this matter</li>
</ul>
